# HeadcrabWhenConsole
A "Consoleless" fork that spawns a headcrab whenever an attempt to request any of the Console domains is made

Just a fun little modification, nothing crazy.

You can modify what headcrab type you desire and if it should launch a canister at "Gorilla Tag\BepInEx\config\Rhosyn.HeadcrabWhenConsole.cfg"
